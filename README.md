The Other Half is a lightweight productivity-enhancing Android app that helps partners to coordinate their lives together! Be it roommates, siblings, couples, project-mates, or any other grouping under the sun, the Other Half is the cleanest, simplest option out there. 

Currently, the Other Half has two main functionalities: a "Bucket List" entity that allows partners to share reach goals during their time together, and a practical calendar of milestones that certainly will be carried out.
